            <p class="ux-method-info">
              I analyzed how this spy camera detector application offers vague means to understand <span>women’s safety</span> from spy cameras in Korea, and additionally how it wields the potential to <span>abuse women’s fear and learned helplessness</span>. Since the minority <span>group’s social psychology</span> center around these feelings, it should be acknowledged as the design elements when aiming for social impact. 
              Furthermore, this acknowledgement should be followed by continuous <span>trust work</span> between the application operators and the users, or the <span>citizens</span>.

              1. Is it possible for the application to help solve social problems when the targeted user group is emotionally unavailable to use the app actively? <br />

              Although social trust cannot be directly inserted or designed into a system, design could create a better world by designing an environment that would encourage the emergence of trust.

            When the human’s basic desire to autonomously govern their world is largely betrayed by a discriminative social environment, negative psychology is produced. Therefore, this negative psychology is easily attached to the people of minority communities. They are much more susceptible to negative feelings like frustration, helplessness, fear, and depression-- stemming from intangible stigmatization and physical threats.

            When technology is not built with consideration of the minority group, this exclusion will engender the reluctance to adopt the technology, particularly for the minority group members, as people can sense that the technology is not intended for them to utilize. On the other hand, appropriate relational association between the application administrators and the users (who are most likely to be Korean women) would engender social trust, which would lead these people to become actual users.

          <p>The Relief’s Map consists of five main features. Although its key features are detecting spy cameras and reporting the detected spot through the map, it has other features such as displaying current news articles, a home feed, and a profile resembling a social media account profile. However, these diverse features confused the users about the app’s overall purpose.
          <br />
          Since <em>Relief's Map</em> aims to help people suffering from spy cameras, it is inevitably linked to social innovation design, which heavily concerns the targeted minority group’s collective social psychology. If learned helplessness is a pervasive feeling within the group, it becomes more difficult for the technology to access the users.
          Therefore, <em>Relief's Map</em>'s social innovation design should be based on trust work and collective social psychology. Consequently, it is pivotal to consider the histories that led to these present dynamics if we are to create change for the future.</p>

            I can’t find any single reason why this app encourages women to actively upload the location status of whether spy cameras are detected or not. I think we are victims… so I don’t think we should be in charge of finding out where the cameras are. That is something the government or well, this app should provide for us. I bet most of us are already exhausted by always being aware of the potential threat and exposure to digital sex crimes, so we barely have the energy or passion left to fill out this map. Information should be offered if it were to make people use the app. (P1)

            I didn’t know this kind of technology existed, which is cool, but well… I don’t know, perhaps because I’m lazy… But I don’t think I’ll use this app because I go out to public places a lot, and it is exhausting for me to check if the cameras are around me or not. Maybe I’m less sensitive than others, but yeah… this is how I honestly think. (P3)

          <p class="align-left">
            I don’t know if I would use this app since, to be real honest, I think I have been filmed at least one time in my life -- I mean, almost every woman probably has been. I somehow got “bold” or whatever to neglect the existence of them around me. Honestly, I thought like that even when I resented this spy camera issue and protested a few times in 2018. But these days, I have become very insensible. Yes, I am still mad, but I am kind of exhausted dealing with the problem that seems unchangeable. (P4)

          <p class="align-right">
            I don’t think the user should be responsible for filling out all the information. Women don’t have the energy to form feminist activism when they are the victims of this terrible situation. I think the product should be able to give all the information needed for the women to use the service frequently. (P5)

          <br />
          <p class="align-left">
            I honestly think the release year was bad timing… I mean, I have engaged in several feminist activisms for the past several years, and I can definitely feel that even the most fierce people fighting for women’s rights are exhausted nowadays. If this application came out in 2018, I think it probably would have gotten more public attention even with this bad user interface and design. Because at that time, we were thirsty for the solution to these ongoing vicious crimes. (P2)

            <h5 class="subtitle capitalize">Incorporation of Participatory Deisgn</h5>
            <p>This paper in particular includes elements of participatory design, but mainly focuses on ethnography.
            Participatory Design is envisioned as a design approach to democratizing the design process by shifting the power relationships between researcher and participant. Indeed, there are some limitations, such as the historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. Nevertheless, within the design process, the importance of Participatory Design as a means to innovate society and contribute to social equality is becoming a significant part of the social innovation design and civic design areas. Moreover, it is one of the most effective design methods for the historically oppressed and marginalized. This goes beyond building the trust between the researcher or application administrator and the users who participate in the design process. 
            Instead, the method of participatory design aims to break the boundary between them and therefore seeks to build equal access to the design. In future research, participatory design can be utilized to further inform and expand the set of possible design choices, hoping for designing technology not only “for” but also “with” the minority communities.
            Furthermore, the study has its limitation on not fully concerning the stake of the for-profit parent corporation.

            <h5 class="subtitle capitalize">Hearing Out from the For-Profit Corporation</h5>
            <p>
              Although this case study is focused on the user experiences directly from the minority group members, for the better social innovation design, hearing out the difficulties from both sides – the for-profit corporation and the (potential) users from the devalued social group would have elicited better design results. While the civic design from the government or not-for-profit organization does not cover financial issues as its key consideration for its end goal is to better the society, the for-profit organization making social innovation design has to end goals: to make money as well as to better the community. Although I contacted Relief’s Map’s parent company in December 2021 and could hear out their situation, including their hardships, I was not able to include data from the corporations, which might have been a way to inform a more realistic design. Furthering this case study considering the corporation’s viewpoint would render other insights to the HCI and User Experience design academia and communities.

            <p class="conclusion-paragraph">Designing technology for minority communities has become a pivotal topic not only within not-for-profit organizations but also for for-profit corporations. Given our current social context, attention towards the emergence and prevalence of for-profits with the primary concerns in minority communities’ well-being is long overdue. Nonetheless, in order for these organizations to contribute to social justice, it is crucial to first comprehend the complex reality of and social psychologies within minority groups. 
            <br />
            Through this case study, I insist on how design wields the potential to abuse women’s fear and learned helplessness, even unintentionally. Since the end goal of the product design should be based on eliciting the optimal user experience, I suggest the usefulness of including the authentic voices of (potential) users. This is as an effort to not misrepresent the user needs as well as the company’s genuine intentions to help these marginalized groups of people. With a better understanding of the complexity of the minority group’s social psychology mentioned in this paper, the design and technology suggestions could pave a way for understanding technology’s place in social justice and transform the ways we protect our women and communities.</p>
